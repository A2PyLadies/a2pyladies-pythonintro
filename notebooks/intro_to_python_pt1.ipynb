      "# Intro to Python\n",
      "\n",
      "Welcome to the Ann Arbor PyLadies/Girl Develop It Detroit Intro to Python class! You're going to learn the basics of Python programming while also learning to build a simple Hangman game. It'll be a fun way to show what you've learned.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can access this page at any time, and I'll distribute the link in class.\n",
      "\n",

      "## About programming\n",
      "\n",
      "What is programming? Programming is teaching the computer to do a task. A program is made up of lines of code in one or more files, each of which solve part of the overall task. A programming language like Python, which is very readable by humans, has to be translated into a form that the machine can understand. Python uses an interpreter to do the translating.\n",
      "\n",
      "## About Python\n",
      "\n",
      "Python is a powerful programming language that's good for beginners to learn because of its readable, clean syntax. It can be used for a variety of things like data analysis, web development, software, and game development. One advantage of using Python is that it's easy to develop things quickly. There are two versions of Python: 2.7.x and 3.3.x. For the purposes of this workshop, we'll use Python 2.7.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Installing Python and a text editor\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's set up our computer for Python programming! The first thing you'll need it Python itself. If you use Mac OS X or Linux, you're in luck: Python comes with those operating systems, so you can skip this step. \n",
      "\n",
      "To install on Windows, click here: http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.6/ You'll most likely want to install either this one: **Windows x86 MSI Installer (2.7.6) (sig)** or this one: **Windows x86 MSI program database (2.7.6) (sig)**. Then, after installing Python, open the \"powershell\" program and type:\n",

      "\n",
      "The next thing you'll want to install is a text editor. If you already have a text editor installed, like TextWrangler or Notepad++, feel free to skip this step. I highly recommend Sublime Text 2: http://www.sublimetext.com/ \n",

      "## Start with interactive shell\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's go back to the interactive shell you started in the terminal/command prompt. (Remember, you can access it by simply typing \"python\".) We're going to play around with some basic operations, just to get a feel for what Python is like.\n",

      "\n",
      "Try typing in the following and hitting 'enter', and see what happens:\n",

      "### Variables\n",
      "\n",
      "Variables are the names of objects that store something. Try typing the following:\n",

      "- a = 10\n",
      "- a\n",
      "\n",
      "<img src=\"files/images/variable.png\">\n",
      "\n",
      "As you can see, when you hit 'enter' after typing the letter 'a', 10 is printed out. That's because by assigning 'a' the value of '10', you're storing the value of '10' inside of 'a'. You can do many things with variables:\n",
      "\n",
      "<img src=\"files/images/variables.png\">\n",
      "\n",
      "### Types\n",
      "\n",
      "Every object in Python has what we call a \"type\". The three most common types that we're going to look at (for now) are *int*, *float*, and *string*.\n",
      "\n",
      "- *Int*: we've already encountered this type! The numbers and the variables from the previous examples are all *ints*. *Int* is short for integer. Any number you type in without any decimals (e.x. 10, 4, 6, 3453453453) are all *ints*.\n",
      "- *Float*: a *float* is a number that is a decimal. So, a *float* could be 56.8, 0.1, and so on. *Float* is short for floating point decimal, or floating point real number.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, you might be wondering how *ints* and *floats* are different. What happens when you try each of the following operations?\n",
      "\n",
      "- 4 / 5\n",
      "- 4.0 / 5.0\n",
      "\n",
      "For *ints*, the operation is rounded down to 0. However, for *floats*, the result is a decimal. \n",
      "\n",
      "- *String*: Strings are most simply thought of as text. To make a string, you have to put single quotes or double quotes around your variable object. Here are some strings:\n",
      "\n",
      "<img src=\"files/images/strings.png\">\n",
      "\n",
      "If you ever get confused about the type of an object, there's an easy way to check with the 'type' function (we'll get more into what functions are later):\n",
      "\n",
      "<img src=\"files/images/types.png\">\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that variable four is a string, even though it's a number, because it's surrounded by single quotes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### raw_input\n",
      "\n",
      "A fun thing you can do, as well as something we'll need for our hangman game, is take input from the command line and store it in a variable. We'll do that with a function called 'raw_input'. Type out the following in the shell:\n",
      "\n",
      "- name = raw_input('What is your name? ')\n",
      "- (Here, type in your name)\n",
      "- name\n",
      "\n",

      "## Moving to the text editor\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we've gotten a bit of a feel for Python syntax, we're going to start writing programs using the text editor we installed.\n",
